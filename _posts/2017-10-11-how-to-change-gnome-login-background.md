If you have used Gnome you must have noticed that there is no option to change the login background in themes.

I wanted to change te background so I made a simple script to do that !

So do the following to change your login-backgrounds.

<br/>

Firstly open up terminal and type in
`git clone https://github.com/uttarayan21/login-background.git`{:#git_clone_login_background}
<br/>
 and press enter



<!-- Wait for the cloning to finish. -->


<br/>

Then type in
`cd login-background`
 and press enter

<br/>

Then type in

`./change-background.sh`
 and follow the instructions given on screen

<br/>

Congrats !! you just changed your login-background in gnome


Here is the repo for the script [uttarayan21/login-background](https://github.com/uttarayan21/login-background)
