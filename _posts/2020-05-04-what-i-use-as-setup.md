## Editor/Terminal

Currently my main editor is [neovim](https://www.github.com/neovim/neovim). It works great with my workflow which is mainly programming.
I also use tmux as my terminal multiplexer and use [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) as my terminal.

I also use a few replacements for the common gnu tools :

* rg or [ripgrep](https://github.com/sharkdp/ripgrep) instead of grep
* [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) instead of find
* [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa) instead of ls

I use [zsh-abbr](https://github.com/olets/zsh-abbr) to alias them to their respective gnu tools.

You can find my dot files on here

## Shell

As my shell I use zsh with [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)  zsh-autosuggestion zsh-syntaxhighlighting and [zsh-abbr](https://github.com/olets/zsh-abbr).

## Distro

As for my distro I primarily use ArchLinux. I have been using arch for about 4 years now and I have been really satisfied with it.
The best thing about arch is that it forced me to learn linux and without arch I would still have not learned linux like I do now.
Also one of the primary reasons for my love of arch is the [aur](https://aur.archlinux.org/). I personally find the aur probably the best features of archlinux.
